# ChessEngine

DISCLAIMER: I used ChatGPT 4o for assitance in this specific project. I've done this type of chess engine without GPTs (coding by hand) in the past and wanted to see how much faster I could do it with ChatGPT as an experiment. SPOILER ALERT: It was incredibly fast. Prompt programming is the way of the future!

## What: 
1. A chess engine with a C++ Backend, web dev frontend, built on Docker dev containers of STIG'd images from IRON BANK, & CMAKE.

## When:
1. Last Updated: 20240601
2. First Started: 20240526

## Why:
1. Testing how fast I could build it with ChatGPT.

## Who: 
1. Those who like chess, C++, docker containers, STIG'd images from iron bank, and CMAKE. 

## Setup:
git clone "repo"
open ChessEnginer in VSCode
reopen in container
cd build
cmake ..
make
./ChessEngine
